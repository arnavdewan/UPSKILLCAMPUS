        <h3>For Adults</h3>
        <p>Adults can register for vaccination by providing their details, selecting a preferred vaccination for a particular disease, and scheduling an appointment. After receiving the vaccine, they can check their vaccination appointment from the portal.</p>
        
        <h3>For Children</h3>
        <p>Parents or guardians can register their children for vaccination by submitting necessary details. The system will provide available vaccination slots and guide them through the process to ensure timely immunization.</p>
        
        <p>Our goal is to ensure a smooth and safe vaccination process for everyone, helping to build a healthier community.</p>
